# Overview

Here we filtered the loan_status column to keep only the rows where the loan was either in default/charged off or was fully paid. 

```{r echo=F}
#Transform loan status
data$loan_status[data$loan_status == "Charged Off"] = "Default"
data$loan_status[data$loan_status == "Does not meet the credit policy. Status:Charged Off"] = "Default"
data= data %>% filter(loan_status == "Default" | loan_status == "Fully Paid")

unique(data$loan_status)
data%>%select(loan_status)%>%group_by(loan_status)%>%count(.)
```


So, from the comments the professor made on our task 3, I am gathering that we could first split the data into X and Y, do all the preprocessing steps, then do the training test split?

```{r}
x = data %>% select(-loan_status)
y = data %>% select(loan_status)

```

# Exploratory Analysis


## Missing Values

The goal of this section is to identify features that are eligible for feature wise deletion in order to make the data set easier to navigate. Part II discusses how to handle any remaining missing values. The original dataset contains 39719 observations and 111 variables.

```{r include=T}
anyNA(x) # to see if there are any missing values in the training set
dim(x) # number of observations and features in the training set
```


```{r echo=F, warning=F, message=F, error=F}
ggplot_missing <- function(x){
if(!require(reshape2)){warning('you need to install reshape2')}
require(reshape2)
require(ggplot2)
#### This function produces a plot of the missing data pattern
#### in x. It is a modified version of a function in the 'neato' package
x %>%
  is.na %>%
  melt %>%
  ggplot(data = .,
         aes(x = Var2,
             y = Var1)) +
  geom_raster(aes(fill = value)) +
  scale_fill_grey(name = "",
                  labels = c("Present","Missing")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45, vjust=0.5)) +
  labs(x = "Variables in Dataset",
       y = "Rows / observations")
}

```

```{r echo=F}
ggplot_missing(x) # visualize missing data
```

The missingness plot indicates that a large amount of features have a high percentage of missing values. The following output shows the exact percentages per feature.

```{r echo=F}
round(colMeans(is.na(x))*100,3)
```

Thus, it makes sense to delete features with a large percentage of missing values. The general rule of thumb is to delete any features with 33% or more.

```{r}
# drop features with a lot of NAs from train and test set
x = x %>% select_if(~mean(is.na(.))<=0.33)

# dimensions of altered dataset
dim(x)
```

After dropping the features that fall into this category, 53 variables remain in the train and test set.  

## Data structures

The following section of code explores the data structures in order to identify any qualitative features that might be coded as quantitative features and vice versa. First, the number of features per data type is displayed.

```{r echo=F}
table(sapply(x[1,],class)) # number of features per data type
```

To get a closer look at the data types for each feature, the following output can be used. 

```{r echo=F}
str(x) # overview of data types
```

Furthermore, the number of unique values per features are displayed.

```{r echo=F}
sapply(x,function(x){ length(unique(x))})
```

There are some qualitative features, some coded as character and some as numeric, that need to be converted to factors. In addition, it seems like some features only have one value (besides NA) and should therefore be dropped. We also found that we will likely be unable to extract any useful information from some features. We also tried to keep only the features that were available to an investor before they invested on the loan. After making some transformations, the dataset looks as follows.

```{r echo=F}

# features with only one value that will be dropped:
#     collections_12_mths_ex_med, 
#     application_type, 
#     policy_code,
#     chargeoff_within_12_mths
#     init_list_status
#     acc_now_delinq
#     delinq_amnt

x = x %>% select(-c(collections_12_mths_ex_med, 
                          application_type, 
                          policy_code, 
                          chargeoff_within_12_mths, 
                          initial_list_status, 
                          acc_now_delinq, 
                          delinq_amnt, 
                          tax_liens))

# These features are uninformative and will be dropped:
# We may need to state why they are uninformative.

# id

# emp_title 
# title

# desc

x = x %>% select(-c(zip_code, 
                          id,

                          emp_title, 
                          title, 
                          url, 
                          desc))

## Extreme observations and skewness

Principal components analysis is used to check for extreme observations. However, it is important to check for skewness first.
Assuming that acceptable values of skewness fall between -1,5 and 1.5, features with values for skewness outside of this range are transformed.
```{r echo=F}
print("train")
(skewed= apply(xQuan, 2, skewness, na.rm=TRUE))
```

The output indicates that some features are heavily skewed.

Here we correct for skewness using the Yeo Johnson method since we are going to visualize outliers using PCA.
```{r echo=F}

#center and scale
xQuanPCA = xQuan %>% preProcess(.) %>% predict(newdata = xQuan)

#Correcting for skewness
skewFeats = names(which(abs(skewed) > 1.5))

xQuanYJ = xQuanPCA %>%
  select(abs(contains(skewFeats))) %>%
  preProcess(method = 'YeoJohnson', na.rm=TRUE) %>%
  predict(xQuanPCA %>% select(contains(skewFeats)))

xQuanNotSkew = xQuanPCA %>% select(!contains(skewFeats))

apply(xQuanYJ, 2, skewness, na.rm=TRUE)

xQuanYJ = cbind(xQuanYJ, xQuanNotSkew)
```

The transformation only had an effect on annual_inc, inq_last_6mnths, and revol_bal.


Extreme observations can be identified via the following PCA output.
```{r echo=F}
pcaOut = prcomp(na.omit(xQuanYJ,scale=TRUE,center=TRUE))
xQuanScores = data.frame(pcaOut$x)
ggplot(data = xQuanScores) + geom_point(aes(x = PC1, y = PC2)) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=range(xQuanScores$PC1), ylim=range(xQuanScores$PC2))

```

It looks like there are 4 outliers. I had to center and sale the data in order to see the 4 extreme observations.

This is the code to check out those extreme observations.
```{r}
(extremeObs = which(xQuanScores$PC2 < -10))

str(xQuan[extremeObs, ])

print('loan amnt')
median(xQuan$loan_amnt)
print('annual inc')
median(xQuan$annual_inc)
print('revolving bal')
median(xQuan$revol_bal)




```

What really stood out to me was the annual income and revolving balances the outliers had. That is probably why they were outliers. It looked like everything was entered properly so I dont think we have a reason to delete them? Maybe we should remove them purely for the sake of model performance and since we want the model to be as applicable as possible?

#Missing Data

we know that there will be no missing data for the qualitative features since we will impute the mode for them. No imputation for the test set we will just predict them with the model.

```{r}

#Counting the missing data
sapply(xQuan, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) 

```

There are not really a lot of missing values for most of our features. Since emp_length isnt really correlated with anything (you can see in the corrplot later), we wont be able to use a linear model to impute values for it. I think it is safe to just impute the median value for these.

```{r}
#mode impute
modeImpute = function(Xqual){
  tbl = table(Xqual)
  Xqual[is.na(Xqual)] = names(tbl)[which.max(tbl)]
  return(Xqual)
}

xQual = xQual %>% mutate(across(.cols=everything(), modeImpute))

#median impute
xQuan = xQuan %>% 
  preProcess(method = 'medianImpute')%>%
  predict(newdata = xQuan)

#Counting the missing data again
sapply(xQual, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) 
sapply(xQuan, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))

```

## Removing correlated variables

Quantitative features with high correlation (p>0.85) are problematic so we will remove them here.

```{r, warning = F, error = F, message = F, echo=F}
datacorr = cor(xQuan)
corrplot(datacorr, order= 'hclust', t1.cex= .35)
str(xQuan)
dim(xQuan)
```

```{r include=T}
#correlated features
highCorr = findCorrelation(datacorr, .85, verbose=T, names=T)
highCorr
```


So here the first chunk removes the correlated variables and the second chunk uses PCA on them to keep some information from them. We can choose either one.

```{r}
#Removing correlated features
xQuan= select(all_of(xQuan), -any_of((highCorr)))
```


#PCA on correlated features
corrFeats = select(xQuan, c(funded_amnt, loan_amnt, funded_amnt_inv))
corrFeatsPCA = preProcess(corrFeats, method = 'pca', thresh = 0.90) %>% predict(corrFeats)
#Putting features back into dataframe as PCA
xQuan = cbind(corrFeatsPCA, xQuan)
#Removing correlated features
xQuan= select(all_of(xQuan), -any_of((highCorr)))
#Checking correlation after PCA
datacorr = cor(xQuan)
corrplot(datacorr, order= 'hclust', t1.cex= .35)
highCorr = findCorrelation(datacorr, .85, verbose=T, names=T)
highCorr

str(xQuan)

The correlation plot indicates that there are a few features with high correlation in the dataset that were removed. 

# Centering and scaling and ensuring nontrivial variation
```{r}


#Centering and scaling the numeric features (dont want to center and scale dummy variables)
xQuan = xQuan %>% preProcess(.) %>% predict(newdata = xQuan)

#Checking features for imbalanced frequencies. Pg 45 in the book recommends removing features if the fraction of unique values to sample size is low (10%) and the ratio of the most prevalent value to 2nd most prevalent value is large (around 20). if both criteria holds they say it may be advantageous to remove it. On pg 55 they show the code for this.

#I asked about this is the Q&A and he pretty much said either method is fine to use. I am going to try it without it.

#str(xQuan)
#freq = nearZeroVar(xQuan, saveMetrics = TRUE)
#xQuan = select_if(xQuan, freq$freqRatio < 30 | freq$percentUnique > 0.10)
#str(xQuan)
